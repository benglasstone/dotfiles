;;; Commentary:

;; The general way we're structuring our init files is to put all of
;; our initialization code modules in files named init-*.el under the
;; "lisp" subdirectory (i.e. inside ~/.emacs.d/lisp).  However, most
;; of the lifting for configuring packages is going to be done by
;; use-package.el which allows us to keep our package configurations
;; neat.  If they don't make sense to put into a use-package call or
;; they start to get big or unwieldy, then they should get their own
;; file in lisp/.

;;; Code:

;;;; General editor configuration


;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; We already do this in our `lisp/init-elpa.el' file.
;(package-initialize)

(tool-bar-mode -1)			; We don't need all those
					; fancy buttons
;; By default, parens are highlighted when you insert a `)`.  We want
;; to make it so that they'll be highlighted any time Point is on
;; them.
(show-paren-mode t)
;; Put emacs customizations into their own file.  We don't need them
;; cluttering up our init.el, especially if we release it for use by
;; others.  If we change its location, we have to load it ourselves.
;; Using the parameter 'noerror makes sure that we ignore the irror
;; for the case where the file doesn't yet exist.
(setq custom-file (locate-user-emacs-file "emacs-custom.el"))
(load custom-file 'noerror)
;; This makes sure that backup files aren't in the way but that they
;; still exist in case we ever need them.  You always think you can
;; get away without backups until you lose something.
